Control mapping file for the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS joystick and throttle.

## Hardware

I've chosen to use the Thrustmaster T.16000M for its balance between cost and their
use of Hall effect magnetic sensors for the majority of user input detection.
The one downside to this model is the the sensor for
detecting movement of twist on the stick is a technology that degrades over
time. This mapping avoids using that sensor and instead uses the rudder input on
the throttle. Overall, a great product for those not looking to invest in more
expensive models.

## Aircraft Style Input

There are two major directions you can go when mapping your controls for Star Citizen.
Some pilots subscribe to a spaceship philosophy and focus on the six degrees of freedom.
Others rely on the Intelligent Flight Control System, or IFCS, to simulate an aircraft
style of control. This mapping is for aircraft style. Now that planets are an
important part of the game and as aerodynamics become more important this is certainly
a valid style.

This mapping is also balanced between being a reasonable configuration for combat but
also supports hours of long distance travel. Cruise control is an important part of
how flight is achieved.
