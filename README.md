Control mapping file for the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS joystick and throttle.

## Hardware

I've chosen to use the Thrustmaster T.16000M for its balance between cost and their
use of magnetic sensors. The one downside to this model is the the sensor for
detecting movement of twist on the stick is a cheaper technology that degrades over
time. This mapping avoids using that sensor and instead uses the rudder paddles on
the throttle. Overall, a great product for those not looking to invest in more
expensive models.
